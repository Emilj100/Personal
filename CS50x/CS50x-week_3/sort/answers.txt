sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Selection sort is usually faster than bubble sort. Which we can also see here.
But on a already sorted list Bubble sort will be much faster than selection sort, since it only has to go through the list once.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It was extremely fast compared to the other sorts. It was the fastest on all 3 tests

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort usually takes the same time no matter if the list is reversed, random or sorted.
But it isnt as fast as merge sort so thats why this one gotta be selection sort.
Since it takes the same time no matter the list then it gotta be this one, since sort1 was faster than usual on a alreader sorted list.
